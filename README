JIT Image Manipulation
------------------------------------

Version: 1.05
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 3rd Aug 2009
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.2 or later

This is a replacement for the /image/X style "just in time" image manipulation found in all versions of Symphony prior to v2.0.2


[INSTALLATION]

** Note: The latest version can alway be grabbed with "git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/jit_image_manipulation.git"

Before you install, it is worth noting that the root .htaccess will be modified. Should you have any modifications, 
it would be worth backing up the original first.

1. Upload the 'jit_image_manipulation' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "JIT Image Manipulation", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.


[CHANGES]

[USAGE]


Basics:

	Image manipulation is controlled via the URL. There are 4 'modes', each with slightly different URL structures
	
	## TODO: Outline the 4 modes here


Trusted Sites:

	In order pull images from external sources, you must set up a white-list of trusted sites. To do this, 
	goto "System > Preferences" and add rules to the "JIT Image Manipulation" rules textarea. To match anything
	use a single asterisk (*).
